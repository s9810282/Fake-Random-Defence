Internal: There are remaining Allocations on the JobTempAlloc. This is a leak, and will impact performance
To Debug, run app with -diag-job-temp-memory-leak-validation cmd line argument. This will output the callstacks of the leaked allocations.
Number of updated asset objects reloaded before import = 0
Number of asset objects unloaded after import = 1
